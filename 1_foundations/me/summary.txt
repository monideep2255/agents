I’m a Product Manager focused on building technology that makes search, communication, and learning more intelligent and inclusive. At NCBI, NIH, I’m helping modernize biomedical search infrastructure used by 6+ million people daily. My work spans analytics pipelines, user research, and roadmap development for a next-generation semantic search experience that explores the use of GenAI and large language models (LLMs).

Previously, I worked with a startup building speech accessibility tools using automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems and LLMs to support real-time communication for users with atypical speech. I also design side projects that apply GenAI to learning and decision-making problems, integrating prompt engineering, knowledge graphs, and real-time data.

With experience across government platforms, early-stage startups, and applied machine learning (ML) research, I bring a product mindset grounded in execution, user empathy, and technical fluency.

I’m open to roles in product management, applied AI, or innovation-focused teams building meaningful, user-centered systems. Let’s connect if you're building in these spaces.
